# Analysis of Misconfigurations and Information Gathering Techniques on web based Tor Hidden Services

This project essentially introduces you to the concept of Tor hidden services, Protocol-Level Attack, the three types of attacks under this method, itâ€™s outcomes, challenges and improvements, some key findings, and mapping vulnerabilities to the key findings.

The act of disclosing the true identity or location of a user or service using the Tor network is known as "deanonymization of onion links." Onion links are connected to dark web domains that are intended to offer anonymity by directing internet traffic via a number of servers run by volunteers. Nonetheless, deanonymization could result from specific flaws or clever attacks, jeopardizing user security and privacy. Methods like traffic analysis, timing attacks, or taking advantage of software flaws may reveal a user's true IP address or location. There are significant concerns associated with deanonymization, particularly in areas where access to specific information may be prohibited or unlawful. The Tor network's ability to provide a private and secure online environment depends on ongoing efforts to patch any flaws and keep ahead of any new threats.
